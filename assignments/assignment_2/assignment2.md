## Introduction

#### Comparative genomics

Comparative genomics asks a "simple question": **what do different genomes have in common, and what makes each one unique?** 

We are approaching step by step to develop a big comparative genomics project, but before handlign 20,000 proteins, let's practice with just five genes. Even though this is a small number of genes, you are starting to make a comparative analysis.

For this assignment, we will work with an **annotation file**. You already know the GTF format from our chromosome 21 and *E. coli* exercises. Now you will use it to compare **five genes** across **four species of vertebrates** separated by up to ~450 million years of evolution.



#### How this project works

You will do everything **manually first**: grep, awk and BLAST on the website. It will feel slow and repetitive, and that is on purpose. Then you will write the workflow **without code**, and finally you will write the **script** (your excecutable .sh file) that does all of it for you. We will run that script for real at Tule server in a couple of weeks.


**Assignment Goals:**
1. Download and explore real genome annotations from four species.
2. Extract gene information (coordinates, strand, transcripts, exons, protein accessions) using only `grep` and `awk`.
3. Use loops and conditionals to download many genes and species at once.
4. Check if the genes exist or not.
5. Translate a manual workflow into a scalable, reproducible script.



## Our species and our genes

We will work with four species that are reference models. 

| Short name | Species | Genome assembly (NCBI RefSeq) |
|---|---|---|
| :mouse: mouse | *Mus musculus* | GRCm39 (GCF_000001635.27) |
| :chicken: chicken | *Gallus gallus* | GRCg7b (GCF_016699485.2) |
| :frog: frog | *Xenopus tropicalis* | UCB_Xtro_10.0 (GCF_000004195.4) |
| :fish: zebrafish | *Danio rerio* | GRCz12tu (GCF_049306965.1) |

And we will analyze five genes:

| Gene | Biological function |
|---|---|
| **TP53** | Tumor suppressor, the "guardian of the genome". Stops cells with damaged DNA from dividing. |
| **AIM2** | Senses foreign DNA floating in the cytoplasm (e.g. from a virus) and triggers inflammation. |
| **TLR9** | Toll-like receptor that recognizes bacterial and viral DNA (CpG motifs) inside the cell. |
| **TLR21** | Another Toll-like receptor that also recognizes CpG DNA. |
| **GULO** | L-gulonolactone oxidase: the last enzyme needed to make vitamin C. |


## :pencil: Exercise 1: Set up your project directories

Create your assignment directory named `assignment_2` inside your `btec_640/` directory with `input_data`, `final_output`, `analysis` and `src` inside.

:warning: Friendly reminder to always check that you are inside your working directory (`btec_640`) with `pwd`.

Inside `analysis/`, create three sub-directories: `gene_survey`, `proteins`, `blast`. **Use a single command line.**

> <details>
> <summary><b> 💡Click here for a hint</b></summary>
>
> `mkdir -p` accepts more than one path at a time, separated by spaces.
></details>

```bash
#Paste your command here:

mkdir -p ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/input_data ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/final_output ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/src ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/analysis/gene_survey ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/analysis/blast ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/analysis/proteins


```

Create a `README` file inside `assignment_2/` with a short description of this project, like you did in your first assignment.

Your structure should look like this:

:open_file_folder: assignment_2
- :page_facing_up: README
- :open_file_folder: input_data
- :open_file_folder: analysis
  - :open_file_folder: gene_survey
  - :open_file_folder: proteins
  - :open_file_folder: blast
- :open_file_folder: final_output
- :open_file_folder: src

:rotating_light: **Remember** to document every command you use today in a separate script document, following our best practices. 




## :pencil: Exercise 2: Download the four annotation files

Move inside `input_data/` and confirm that you are there? Paste the commands and the outputs:

```bash
#Paste your command and output here:

cd ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST
touch README
cd ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/input_data

```

Download the four GTF files from NCBI with `curl`:

```bash
curl -o mouse.gtf.gz "https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/001/635/GCF_000001635.27_GRCm39/GCF_000001635.27_GRCm39_genomic.gtf.gz"

curl -o chicken.gtf.gz "https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/016/699/485/GCF_016699485.2_bGalGal1.mat.broiler.GRCg7b/GCF_016699485.2_bGalGal1.mat.broiler.GRCg7b_genomic.gtf.gz"

curl -o frog.gtf.gz "https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/004/195/GCF_000004195.4_UCB_Xtro_10.0/GCF_000004195.4_UCB_Xtro_10.0_genomic.gtf.gz"

curl -o zebrafish.gtf.gz "https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/049/306/965/GCF_049306965.1_GRCz12tu/GCF_049306965.1_GRCz12tu_genomic.gtf.gz"
```
 
:question: Before continuing, do a sanity check: list the files with their sizes (`ls -lh`). Each file should be between ~15 and ~40 MB. What would it mean if one of them was only a few KB?

```
Type your answer:

The file failed to download fully


```

Now unzip all four **using a `for` loop**, exactly like we did in the *E. coli* exercise.

>[!CAUTION]
> Once unzipped, these four files together take **~3 GB** of disk space. Check that you have space before unzipping. Be careful with the `*` wildcard: make sure you are inside `input_data/`.

```bash
#Paste your loop here:

ls -lh

for f in *.gz; do
    gunzip "$f"
done



```

## :pencil: Exercise 3: Explore the files

Go to `analysis/gene_survey/` and create a soft link to each GTF file, like we did with chromosome 21. 

```bash
#Paste your command here:

cd ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/analysis/gene_survey
ln -s ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/input_data/chicken.gtf
ln -s ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/input_data/frog.gtf
ln -s ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/input_data/mouse.gtf
ln -s ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/input_data/zebrafish.gtf

```

Open `mouse.gtf` with `less`, and then look at the first 10 lines with `head`.

:question: The first lines start with `#!`. What information do they contain? Why is this information important for reproducibility?

```
Type your answer:

It gives information about the file's source, date of creation and associated reference genomes. This allows researchers to check genome files like these against databases to confirm data integrity.


```

:question: Compare column 1 of this file with column 1 of the `hg38.ncbiRefSeq.gtf` file from our chromosome 21 class. What is different? Using the RefSeq prefix table from that class, what does the `NC_` prefix tell you?

```
Type your answer:

"NC_" is raw genomic data


```

## :pencil: Exercise 4: How many genes does each species have?

Each gene has exactly **one** line where column 3 is `gene`. Use `awk` to keep only those lines and count them with `wc -l`.

>[!TIP] **Syntax: awk with a condition on a column**
>
>```bash
>awk -F'/t' '$3=="gene"' FILENAME
>```
>- `$3=="gene"` is the CONDITION: only lines where column 3 is exactly `gene` are printed.
>- Note the **double** equal sign `==`. It means "is equal to" (a comparison), not "assign".

```bash
#Paste your commands here (one per species):

awk -F'\t' '$3=="gene"' mouse.gtf > mouse_genes.gtf
awk -F'\t' '$3=="gene"' zebrafish.gtf > zebrafish_genes.gtf
awk -F'\t' '$3=="gene"' frog.gtf > frog_genes.gtf
awk -F'\t' '$3=="gene"' chicken.gtf > chicken_genes.gtf
wc -l mouse_genes.gtf
wc -l zebrafish_genes.gtf
wc -l frog_genes.gtf
wc -l chicken_genes.gtf

```

:bulb: To fill a table in markdown, each || represents a column. Look at my notes in the table below for referenece. 

| Species | Number of genes |
|---|---|
| mouse | 50766 |
| chicken | 25638 |
| frog | 28938 |
| zebrafish | 49663 |

:question: Why do you think the numbers are different? Is the species with the most genes the "most complex"? Is the number of genes a biological fact, or a result of how well the genome was annotated?

```
Type your answer:

Number of genes does not equal organism complexity especially in eukaryotes where alternatives splicing can create many distinct transcripts from a single gene. Zebrafish and mouse have better documented genomes as common model animals than frog and chicken.


```

## :pencil: Exercise 5: Dissect one gene by hand

Let's take one gene in one species and extract everything we can about it. We will use **TLR9 in mouse**.

In the NCBI annotation, every line that belongs to a gene carries its name in column 9 as `gene_id "NAME";`

>[!TIP] **Syntax: grep with special characters**
>
>```bash
>grep -i 'gene_id "tlr9";' mouse.gtf > tlr9_mouse.gtf
>```
>- The **single quotes** `' '` protect everything inside, including the double quotes `"`.
>- Why include `gene_id "` and `";`? Because `grep -i "tlr9"` alone would also catch any gene that *contains* tlr9 in its name. Try it and see what happens!
>- `-i` makes the search **case-insensitive**. Why could that matter across species? Keep this in mind.

Run the command above and open `tlr9_mouse.gtf`. Then answer:


```
1. How many lines does this file have? Which command did you use?


grep -i 'gene_id "tlr9";' mouse.gtf > tlr9_mouse.gtf
wc -l tlr9_mouse.gtf
less -h 10 tlr9_mouse.gtf


2. Using the line where column 3 is "gene": on which chromosome/sequence is Tlr9, what are its start and end coordinates?

The NC corresponds to chromosome 9 and its coords are 106099797-106104075

3. How long is the gene (in bp)? Show your calculation.

106104075-106099797 = 4278

4. How many exons does this gene has and which are the start and end position of each exon?

2 exons
exon 1 106099797-106099905
exon 2 106100714-106104075



```

>[!TIP]
> To see only the exon lines use: `awk -F'/t' '$3=="exon"' tlr9_mouse.gtf`
>
> :warning: A gene can have more than one transcript (isoform), and **each transcript lists its own exons**, so you may see the same exons repeated with a different `transcript_id`. Report the exons of the **first** transcript only.


## :pencil: Exercise 6: Repeat for all five genes

Repeat Exercise 5 for **all five genes in mouse and in chicken**. That is 10 `grep` commands. Fill the table:


| Gene | Species | Found? (Y/N) | Chromosome/sequence | Start | End |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TP53 | mouse | False | - | - | - |
| AIM2 | mouse | True | NC_000067.7	| 173177105	| 173293606	|
| TLR9 | mouse | True |NC_000075.7	|106099797	 |106104075	 |
| TLR21 | mouse | False | - | - | - |
| GULO | mouse | True | NC_000080.7	| 66224235	| 66246703	|
| TP53 | chicken | True |NW_024096016.1	| 5925	| 24899	|
| AIM2 | chicken | False | - | - | - |
| TLR9 | chicken | False | - | - | - |
| TLR21 | chicken | True | NC_052542.1	| 308996	|335580	 |
| GULO | chicken | False | - | - | - |

:question: Imagine doing this for 20,000 genes in 50 species. Which part of what you just did was **exactly the same** every time, and which part **changed**?

```
Type your answer:

the grep, and what changed was reading the file whether it existed or not


```

:question: Using VARIABLES and/or loops, how would you optimize this task? No need to write the command, write the logic and workflow that YOU would follow. 

```
Type your answer:

For each species, for each genes whether it exists in that species or not, return the notation for chromosome, and the start and end positions


```

## :pencil: Exercise 7: Survey everything with a loop


You already know the `for` loop. Now we need **two** loops, one inside the other: for each species, go through every gene.

>[!TIP] **Syntax: nested `for` loops**
>
>```bash
>for SPECIES in mouse chicken frog zebrafish
>do
>    for GENE in tp53 aim2 tlr9 tlr21 gulo
>    do
>        COMMAND using $SPECIES and $GENE
>    done
>done
>```

:question: In your own words, explain what this command is doing and the **logic** behind it.

```
Type your answer:

For each species file, a nested loop is run which for a number of genes execute a command against them



```
When we grep a gene that isn't in the file, `grep` still creates the output file, but it is **empty**. This is where `if`/`else` comes in. Remember the syntax from our chromosome 21 class:

>[!TIP] **Syntax: `if` / `else` with `[ -s FILE ]`**
>
>```bash
>if [ -s "$file" ]
>then
>    COMMANDS_IF_TRUE
>else
>    COMMANDS_IF_FALSE
>fi
>```
>- `[ -s "$file" ]` asks: "does this file exist **and** is it not empty?"
>- The syntax of IF/ELSE always require spaces inside the brackets: `[ -s "$file" ]`, if your command fails because of syntax the most common reason is that you did not left a space: `[-s "$file"]`.

>[!TIP] **Syntax: variables inside double quotes**
>
>Our grep pattern has double quotes inside it (`gene_id "tlr9";`). To use a **variable** inside a pattern, the pattern must be in **double** quotes (single quotes don't expand variables), so the inner quotes need a backslash `/"`:
>```bash
>grep -i "gene_id /"${GENE}/";" ${SPECIES}.gtf
>```
>The backslash tells bash: "this `"` is a real character to search for, not the end of my text".

Complete the blanks and run the loop inside `analysis/gene_survey/`:

```bash
for SPECIES in mouse chicken frog zebrafish
do
    for GENE in tp53 aim2 tlr9 tlr21 gulo
    do
        grep -i "gene_id \"${GENE}\";" ${SPECIES}.gtf > ${GENE}_${SPECIES}.gtf

        if [ -s ${GENE}_${SPECIES}.gtf ]
        then
            echo "${GENE} ${SPECIES} FOUND"
        else
            echo "${GENE} ${SPECIES} NOT_FOUND"
            rm ${GENE}_${SPECIES}.gtf
        fi
    done
done > gene_survey.txt
```

>[!NOTE]
> The `> gene_survey.txt` after the last `done` saves **everything** the loop prints into one file.

:question: Why do we remove the file in the `else` block? What would happen later if we left it there? If you don't know the answer, run the command withour removing the file and see what happens.

```
Type your answer:

We would create blank files for genes that dont exist

```

Open `gene_survey.txt` and copy the results into the table:

| Gene | mouse | chicken | frog | zebrafish |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TP53 | False | True | True | True |
| AIM2 | True | False | False | False |
| TLR9 | True | False | False | True |
| TLR21 | False | True | True | True |
| GULO | True | False | False | False |


## :pencil: Exercise 8: Download the protein sequences

A `NOT_FOUND` means only one thing: **grep did not find that text in that file.** It does not (yet) mean the gene is missing from the organism. There are several possible explanations:

1. The gene has a **different official name** in that species.
2. The gene is annotated, but without an official name yet (a placeholder ID, often `LOC` + numbers).
3. The gene is not annotated at all, but it **is** in the genome (the annotation pipeline missed it).
4. The gene is truly **absent** from the genome.

To check this, we can do a Blast search:

For every gene that **is** annotated download the protein sequence.

1. Build a file named `protein_list.txt` with three columns: gene, species, protein accession. Use a similar approach to the one we used in the Chromosome 21 excercisse but instead of searching for the NM_ prefix, look for `NP_` or `XP_` because we want the Protein gene accession number. It should look like this:

```
tlr9 mouse NP_XXXXXXXXX.X
tlr9 frog XP_XXXXXXXXX.X
...
```

>[!TIP] **Syntax: `grep -o` (print only the match)**
>
>The protein accession is inside the `protein_id` attribute (in the `CDS` lines), not in the same position as the transcript accession we used in chromosome 21. To get it:
>```bash
>grep -o 'protein_id "NP_[^"]*"' tlr9_mouse.gtf | sort -u
>```
>- `-o` prints **only** the part of the line that matches, not the whole line.
>- `[^"]*` means "any characters that are not a quote".
>
>:warning: Some genes (especially in chicken, frog and zebrafish) only have a **predicted** protein, with the `XP_` prefix. If you don't find an `NP_`, search for `XP_` instead (like `tlr9 frog` in the example above).

```bash
#Paste the commands you used:

for SPECIES in mouse chicken frog zebrafish
do
    for GENE in tp53 aim2 tlr9 tlr21 gulo
    do
        FILE="${GENE}_${SPECIES}.gtf"

        PROTEIN=$(grep -o 'protein_id "[NX]P_[^"]*"' "$FILE" |
                  grep -o '[NX]P_[^"]*' |
                  sort -u)

        if [ -n "$PROTEIN" ]
        then
            echo "$GENE $SPECIES $PROTEIN" >> protein_list.txt
        fi
    done
done



```

2. Move to `analysis/proteins/` and download all the protein sequences **in a single `while read` loop**, like the chromosome 21 exercise.

:warning: In chromosome 21 excercise, we downloaded nucleotide sequences with `db=nuccore`, WE NEED TO CHANGE THE URL BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING FOR PROTEINS NO NUCLEOTIDES:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/btec-640_TEST/assignment_2/analysis/proteins

while read -r gene species accession
do
    curl -o "${gene}_${species}.faa" "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=protein&id=${accession}&rettype=fasta&retmode=text"
    sleep 1
done < ../gene_survey/protein_list.txt
```
> Why `sleep 1`? NCBI blocks users who send too many requests per second. Being polite to a public server is part of best practices.

```bash
#Paste your command loop here:
while read -r gene species accession
do
    curl -o "${gene}_${species}.faa" "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=protein&id=${accession}&rettype=fasta&retmode=text"
    sleep 1
done < ../gene_survey/protein_list.txt



```

3. Check that every `.faa` file has one header and a sequence (`grep -c ">" *.faa`). Then combine all species for each gene into **one multi-FASTA file** per gene (e.g. `tlr9_all.faa`).

Example:

 ```bash
cat tp53_*.faa > tp53_all.faa
cat aim2_*.faa > aim2_all.faa
cat tlr9_*.faa > tlr9_all.faa
cat tlr21_*.faa > tlr21_all.faa
cat gulo_*.faa > gulo_all.faa
 ```
 Explain what does this command do and run it for every gene.

```
Type your answer

It outputs the text of all files that start with the prefix prior to * into a single new text file

```


## :pencil: Exercise 9: Confirm with BLAST

We want to know if a gene exists in a **genome**, even if nobody annotated it.

:question: We have a protein sequence (the query) and we want to search a genome (DNA). Which BLAST program do we need: `blastn`, `blastp`, `blastx` or `tblastn`? And why would `blastp` against the protein database **not** answer our question?

> <details>
> <summary><b> 💡Click here for a hint</b></summary>
>
> Where do the proteins in the protein database come from? From the same annotation you just grepped...
></details>

```
Type your answer:

To search from a fasta (residue) sequence in genomic DNA, including for unannotated genes, use tblastn


```

:question: Why do we use the **protein** instead of the DNA sequence to search in a species that diverged hundreds of millions of years ago?

```
Type your answer:

The functional protein identity is more conserved than the nucleotide identity, where multiple codons may code for the same residue and thus there is room for error

```

Go to [NCBI BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and choose **tblastn**.

- **Query:** paste the protein sequence that you got (the content of your `.faa` file).
- **Database:** `RefSeq Genome Database (refseq_genomes)`.
- **Organism:** type the species you are testing and select it from the list.
- Click **BLAST** and be patient :hourglass:.

Run one search for every `NOT_FOUND` in your survey table (Exercise 7). As query, use the protein you downloaded from a species where the gene **was** found. Record the **top hit** and decide if the gene is present or absent:

| # | Gene | Query (protein file) | Search in… | % Identity | Query cover | E-value | Present or Absent? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | TP53 | `tp53_chicken.faa` | mouse | | | | |
| 2 | AIM2 | `aim2_mouse.faa` | chicken | | | | |
| 3 | AIM2 | `aim2_mouse.faa` | frog | | | | |
| 4 | AIM2 | `aim2_mouse.faa` | zebrafish | | | | |
| 5 | TLR9 | `tlr9_mouse.faa` | chicken | | | | |
| 6 | TLR21 | `tlr21_chicken.faa` | mouse | | | | |
| 7 | TLR21 | `tlr21_chicken.faa` | frog | | | | |
| 8 | GULO | `gulo_mouse.faa` | chicken | | | | |
| 9 | GULO | `gulo_mouse.faa` | frog | | | | |
| 10 | GULO | `gulo_mouse.faa` | zebrafish | | | | |

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **A hit is not the same as the gene.** Proteins belong to families that share domains, so a TLR9 query will also find *other* Toll-like receptors. A real gene gives a hit that covers **most of the protein** (high query cover) with a **very small E-value**. A hit that covers only a small piece of the protein is usually just a shared domain from a different gene. Use search #1 (TP53) as your example of what a real hit looks like.

:question: Now fill the **final** table, using all your evidence: **P** = present, **A** = absent.

| Gene | mouse | chicken | frog | zebrafish |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TP53 | | | | |
| AIM2 | | | | |
| TLR9 | | | | |
| TLR21 | | | | |
| GULO | | | | |

:question: Compare this table with your grep survey (Exercise 7). How many conclusions would have been **wrong** if you had stopped at the annotation file?

```
Type your answer:




```

## :pencil: Exercise 10: Write the workflow (no code)

You have now done every step of this analysis by hand. Without writing any code, describe the full workflow. For each step, write: **what goes in, what comes out, and which command/tool does it.**

```
Step 1:
    Input: Link
    Output: Annotated genomes.gtf.gz
    Tool/command: Curl

Step 2:
    Input: Annotated genomes.gz
    Output: Annotated genomes.gtf
    Tool/command: Gunzip

Step 3:
    Input: Annotated genomes.gtf
    Output: Genes.gtf
    Tool/command: Awk 

Step 4:
    Input: Genes.gtf
    Output: Individual genes of interest gtf files from each species
    Tool/command: Grep

Step 5: 
    Input: Individual genes of interest gtf files from each species
    Output: List of proteins
    Tool/command: Grep 

Step 6: 
    Input: List of proteins of interest
    Output: Protein sequences
    Tool/command: Curl 

Step 7: 
    Input: Link
    Output: Genome nucleotide sequences
    Tool/command: Curl 

Step 8: 
    Input: Genome nucleotides sequence
    Output: Blast database
    Tool/command: Makeblastdb

Step 9: 
    Input: Blast database, protein sequence
    Output: Similarity comparison
    Tool/command: tblastn






```

:question: Which steps did you repeat many times? Those are your **loops**. Which steps depended on a result (found / not found)? Those are your **`if`/`else`**. Mark them in your workflow.

## :pencil: Exercise 11: Write your script

Write a script named `gene_survey_pipeline.sh` inside `assignment_2/src/`. **You will not run it yet**: we will run it on the cluster. Write it as if you were handing it to a colleague who has never seen this project.

On the cluster we won't use the BLAST website. We will download each genome, build a BLAST database, and run `tblastn` locally, refer to Blast website manual and use the syntax below to write your script:


>[!TIP] **Syntax: `makeblastdb`** 
>```bash
>makeblastdb -in GENOME.fna -dbtype nucl -out DATABASE_NAME
>```

>[!TIP] **Syntax: `tblastn`**
>```bash
>tblastn -query PROTEIN.faa /
>        -db DATABASE_NAME /
>        -evalue 1e-5 /
>        -max_target_seqs 5 /
>        -outfmt "6 qseqid sseqid pident length qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore qcovs" /

>- `-outfmt 6` writes a tab-separated table (one hit per line) instead of a long text report. The words after `6` choose the columns. Which of these columns match what you recorded in Exercise 9?
>- The `/` at the end of a line means "the command continues on the next line". It makes long commands readable.


**Your script must include:**

- [ ] A header: purpose, author, date, how to run it, input files, output files, tools and versions.
- [ ] Variables at the top: at least `WORKDIR`, a list of species, and a list of genes. **No path should be written twice.**
- [ ] Directory creation (input, analysis sub-directories, output).
- [ ] Download of the GTF files **and** the genome FASTA files (hint: the genome file is in the same NCBI folder as the GTF, ending in `_genomic.fna.gz`).
- [ ] The survey loop with `if`/`else` (Exercise 7).
- [ ] Protein download for the genes that were found (Exercise 8).
- [ ] BLAST database construction for each genome.
- [ ] `tblastn` for every gene that was **NOT_FOUND**, using the protein of a species where it was found as query.
- [ ] A comment before every block explaining **what** it does and **why**.
